## Outline

-   This is *extremely* work-in-progress!
-   Any and all comments much appreciated

## Background

-   This question came from the work of the [Policing the Pandemic in Scotland](https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/research/research-projects/policing-the-pandemic) project with excellent colleagues [Dr Vicky Gorton](https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/people/dr-victoria-gorton) and [Prof Susan McVie](https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/people/professor-susan-mcvie)

-   Vicky has been leading on our linked data analysis, which has brought together data on all people in Scotland who received a FPN for breaching the covid regulations between X and Y with information on their health and (some) social circumstances, as well as a comparison group of matched controls

-   We want to know if people with more 'vulnerability' (read - service use) are more likely to have received a Covid FPN

-   Because we have a case-control study design (people we know received a FPN and matched controls), we used conditional logistic regression [@kuo2018]

-   We had three controls for each case

-   (Although some people say this is the wrong thing because of course they do)

## Stats

-   One downside of the case-control design (and conditional logistic regression as a method) is that the Intercept in your regression model is basically meaningless

-   The interecept reflects the prevalence of your outcome in your data for your reference category

-   With a case-control design, the prevalence of the outcome is set by the study design - with three control for every case the prevalence of the outcome for the whole study is going to be 25%. This tells us nothing useful!

-   So we (as is recommended) default to using Odds Ratios

-   However, some of our odds ratios are very high (up to 35!)

-   If we were using regular logistic regression then we could happily construct marginal effects of our key variables, present them as percentage changes and get on with our lives

-   ... but we can't do this (see above)

## So what now?

-   So we've been puzzling about what we *can* do. What follows is the result of going down this rabbit-hole

-   It's only loosely related to our actual project!

## What is a marginal effect?

-   What we want to do is describe our Odds Ratios as differences in probabilities

-   What we can do is describe *all* the differences in probabilities that are consistent with a given Odds Ratio

-   This is just maths - for a particular odds ratio and a fixed 'reference' probability, we can calculate the difference in probabilities

-   So if we just take a bunch of reference probabilities and odds ratios we can calculate the difference in probabilities that the odds ratios describe

## Difference in probabilities

-   This is the same data as above but showing the difference probabilities, not the raw probabilities

## Marginal effects

- Every marginal effect for an Odds Ratio of 35 is on this line

- This line represents the Universe of marginal effects for an odds ratio of 35

- Aside: This is also a nice way of thinking about different flavours of marginal effect

## Marginal effects at the mean

# Marginal effects at representative values

## Average marginal effects

## Back to our data

![](03_figures/our_dat_plot.png)
- Very approximately, our Odds Ratio of 35 implies a difference in probabilities of around 66%!


- for our study approximately 92% of people with 3 or more health conditions
 had an FPN? yeah i think so!

- increase in prob from prob of having an fpn with ! 3 or more health conditions

- so n_fpn !3+ health / n_fpn 3+ health + n_ctrl 3+ health

- compared to n_fpn 3+ health / n_fpn 3+ health + n_ctrl 3+health


## We know things

- But we know that this is not true in the population

- In fact, we know pretty precisely that the prevalence of getting a FPN in lockdown one for the whole population was around 0.0044%

## Our plot again

![](03_figures/our_dat_plot2.png)

- This is an increase in probabilities of closer to 1.5 percentage points not 66

## Was all this pointless?

- But also... what's wrong with an odds ratio of 35?

- We have no issue of generalizability - we have 100% of the relevant people

- We also have either a massive issue with transportability/external validity, or we have no issue at all - it seems nonsensical to suggest that these results would generalize to another country or another pandemic. The results for lockdown one in Scotland don't even generalize to lockdown two - that's in our paper!

## Also discriminatory accuracy

- Hopefully I get chance to talk about this too

## Thank you!
