    "text": "Background\n\nThis question came from the Policing the Pandemic in Scotland project with excellent colleagues Dr Vicky Gorton and Prof Susan McVie\nVicky has been leading on our linked data analysis, which has brought together data on all people in Scotland who received a FPN for breaching the covid regulations between X and Y with information on their health and (some) social circumstances, as well as a comparison group of matched controls\nWe want to know if people with more ‘vulnerability’ (read - health service use) are more likely than others to have received a Covid FPN\nBecause we have a case-control study design (all people we know received a FPN and matched controls), we used conditional logistic regression (kuo2018?)\nWe had three controls for each case\n(Although some people say this is the wrong method because of course they do)"

This tells us nothing useful!"
