    "text": "Background\n\nThis question came from the work of the Policing the Pandemic in Scotland project with excellent colleagues Dr Vicky Gorton and Prof Susan McVie\nVicky has been leading on our linked data analysis, which has brought together data on all people in Scotland who received a FPN for breaching the covid regulations between X and Y with information on their health and (some) social circumstances, as well as a comparison group of matched controls\nWe want to know if people with more ‘vulnerability’ (read - service use) are more likely to have received a Covid FPN\nBecause we have a case-control study design (people we know received a FPN and matched controls), we used conditional logistic regression (kuo2018?)\nWe had three controls for each case\n(Although some people say this is the wrong thing because of course they do)"

    "text": "Stats\n\nOne downside of the case-control design (and conditional logistic regression as a method) is that the Intercept in your regression model is basically meaningless\nThe interecept reflects the prevalence of your outcome in your data for your reference category\nWith a case-control design, the prevalence of the outcome is set by the study design - with three control for every case the prevalence of the outcome for the whole study is going to be 25%. This tells us nothing useful!\nSo we (as is recommended) default to using Odds Ratios\nHowever, some of our odds ratios are very high (up to 35!)\nIf we were using regular logistic regression then we could happily construct marginal effects of our key variables, present them as percentage changes and get on with our lives\n… but we can’t do this (see above)"
